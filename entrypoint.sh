# pass's system prompt. Files starting with an underscore are not personas;
# _shared.md is the output contract appended to every persona body in that tree.
#
# Definitions live in files rather than inline here for three reasons: it keeps
# ~200 lines of prompt text out of this script, it gives an operator an override
# by mounting their own directory at PERSONA_DIR, and it keeps the imported text

# Prompts are PR-scoped and mode-scoped. Every one of them substitutes the

# uses REVIEW_PROMPT to start a pair's session and FOLLOWUP_PROMPT to resume it
# on a later cycle, and plan mode uses PLAN_REVIEW_PROMPT and
# PLAN_FOLLOWUP_PROMPT for the same two jobs. The bare names stay code mode, so
# an operator who tunes the code prompt cannot silently change what a plan PR
# gets asked. The four defaults are built below and land in MODE_REVIEW_PROMPT /
# MODE_FOLLOWUP_PROMPT, keyed by mode.
#
# The gh constraints in these prompts are not style advice: they are what the
# privilege-minimized token can actually do. A bare `gh pr view` asks for
# statusCheckRollup, and a fine-grained PAT has no permission that grants it, so
# the whole command fails on a permission error that reads like a token
# misconfiguration. Naming the exact working invocation is cheaper than letting
# each session rediscover it -- and a session that burns its first tool calls on
# 403s tends to start guessing at the diff instead of reading it.
#
# The test stanza exists because "review the tests" is not a strong enough
# instruction on its own: a reviewer reads a new test, sees it assert something
# true about the new code, and moves on. The failure that motivated this was a
# PR whose tests passed identically with the production change reverted -- the
# tests were real, readable, and worthless as regression protection, and the
# review said nothing. The fix is to name the check as a procedure rather than a
# quality ("mentally revert the change, does this test still pass?"), because a
# procedure is something a model can actually run against a diff, whereas "is
# this a good test?" resolves to "it looks like the other tests."
_test_stanza="Treat the tests in this PR as code under review in their own right, not as evidence that the change works. For each test the PR adds or modifies, run this check explicitly: identify which specific lines of the non-test change it depends on, mentally revert just those lines, and decide whether the test would still pass. A test that passes against the pre-change code is not a regression test, and that it exercises the new code path is not the same thing -- exercising is not asserting. Raise every such test as a finding, and say in the comment which mutation of the production code survives it. Apply the same mutation thinking beyond a straight revert: would the test still pass if a boundary moved by one, a condition were negated, an error branch were deleted, a returned collection came back empty, or the function returned a fixed value? Also flag tests that lock in as-implemented behavior instead of intended behavior -- assertions that restate the implementation, recompute the expected value with the same logic the code under test uses, assert on a mock's own stubbed return, or freeze whatever the code currently emits (snapshots included) without any statement of what is actually required. A test should read as a claim about what the code must do that a reader could check against the ticket or the PR description. Call out tests that cannot fail (no assertion reached, assertions after an early return or inside a never-taken branch, a swallowed exception, a tautological comparison) and tests whose name or docstring promises a behavior the body never checks. Where a change adds a behavior with no test that would catch its removal, say so and name the missing case; where the tests are genuinely adequate, say nothing about them."
_gh_stanza="Two constraints on the GitHub CLI here, because the token is deliberately privilege-minimized: always pass an explicit --json field list to \`gh pr view\` (a bare \`gh pr view\` also fetches statusCheckRollup, which this token cannot be granted permission for, so it fails outright), and do not use \`gh pr checks\` at all -- it needs that same permission and cannot work. CI status is therefore unavailable to you: review the code on its own merits, and never wait on or refer to check results."
# The plan stanza does two jobs. It says what to review, and it says what NOT to
# flag: a code-shaped reviewer handed a design document will reliably report
# missing error handling in code nobody has written, and a review full of that is
# a review nobody reads. Like the others it is appended to the DEFAULTS only.

Where you object, say what you would do instead. There is no implementation to inspect, so do not ask for tests, error handling, or input validation in code that does not exist yet; a gap in the plan's own reasoning is a finding, a gap in code it has not written is not."

# Anthropic /v1/messages in, OpenAI /chat/completions out, streaming and tool
# calls included. Tool calling is the whole job of a reviewer, which is why an
# off-the-shelf translator that already gets it right beats one of our own.

#   anthropic  - Anthropic's own API.
#   custom     - any other Anthropic-compatible endpoint you point us at.
#   cloudflare - a Cloudflare AI Gateway fronting Anthropic, Bedrock, or Vertex
#                (GATEWAY_UPSTREAM picks which).
#   workersai  - a Cloudflare Workers AI model, through the bundled translator.
# Whichever backend is chosen, we pin EVERY model tier to the single
# $REVIEW_MODEL. A non-Anthropic backend has no Opus/Sonnet/Haiku models, so if
# a subagent or alias requests an un-overridden tier, Claude Code errors out on
# an unknown model; mapping them all to $REVIEW_MODEL keeps any request valid.
# (On Anthropic this also guarantees one model does every bit of the work.)
